# Online Store
Create online store withe following requirements:
## HTML
- Create a homepage for your store.
- Create at least 2 other pages (this could include pages such as “about us”, “meet the team”, “shipping details”, etc).
- Additionally, your site must have a catalogue page which lists the items which are for sale.
- Your catalogue page should have at least 5 items for sale (include some details of the item).
- Within the entirety of your site, you should have the following elements:
    - At least 5 images.
    - At least 3 font sizes (to help differentiate sections).
    - At least 2 external links (maybe to a shipping company, or an email address).
    - At least 1 table.
    - At least 1 list (ordered or unordered, you can choose).
    - At least one submit button form (possibly to simulate a login - don’t worry about the functionality of this yet).
    - At least one radio button form (you could select different kinds of shipping methods to your location).
    - At least one quote/testimonial (this could be from a previous customer or a review).


## CSS
- Within the entirety of your site, you should have the following styling:
    - Use either Grid OR flex or both of them to organize your products
    - At least 3 font styles with different colouring effects.
    - Padding for all images and buttons.
    - Borders for all images and tables.
    - Background colours/images for all pages.
    - All tables must have customised formatting (colours, layout, etc).
    - Center all content, with the exception of multiple row items being equally padded around the centre.
    - All lists must be customised.
    - Apply a colour ﬁlter to at least 2 images.

## Bonus
- Clicking on an item should allow the user to see more details about the item, such as a brief description,.specifications and price

- Animate item images to expand when hovered over (or clicked on if you prefer).
- The website should be responsive.
